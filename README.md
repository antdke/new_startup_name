## Installation
1. clone the repo
2. `cd speedrail && bundle` (installs dependencies)
3. `rails g rename:into new_app_name` (then `cd ../new_app_name` to refresh)
4. remove `gem 'rename'` from Gemfile, then `bin/setup` to create DB
5. `bundle exec figaro install`
6. `cp config/application-sample.yml config/application.yml` (put ENV vars here)

## Development
```sh
bin/dev # uses foreman to boot server, frontend, and bg job queue
```

**troubleshooting**
`Turbo Drive` lazy-loads pages following form submission, causing script tags at the bottom of following views to not always load.

```html
<!-- add data-turbo=false to form submission buttons if the following view needs a full render -->
<button data-turbo="false" type="submit" ...>Submit</button>
```

## Testing
```
bundle exec rspec # run all tests inside spec/
bundle exec rspec spec/dir_name # run all tests inside given directory
```

## Deploying
```sh
figaro heroku:set -e production # you only need to do this once
heroku git:remote -a heroku_app_name_here # you only need to do this once
```

```sh
git push heroku master # deploys master branch
git push heroku some_branch_name:master # deploys non-master branch
```

**note**: Heroku must have 2 'dynos' enabled, `web` + `worker`, to process background jobs. if you don't need a queue, simply remove the `worker` task from `Procfile` and don't invoke `.delayed` functions.

## Miscellaneous
to use Postmark for emails, set `postmark_api_token` inside `application.yml`, then [verify your sending domain](https://account.postmarkapp.com/signature_domains/initialize_verification).
